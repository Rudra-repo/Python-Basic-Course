# Types of Operators :-
# Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,//,%,**)
# Relational/Comparison opertors (==,!=,<,>,>=,<=)
# Assignment operators (=,-=,+=,/=,//=,*=,%=,**=)
# Logical operators (not,and,or)        [Operation Precidence/order : not > and > or]
# Membership operators (in,not in)
# Bitwise operators (&,|,^)


# Arithmetic Operators :-

a = 4
b = 3

print(a+b)              # To add the numbers
print(a-b)              # To subtract the numbers
print(a*b)              # To multiply the numbers
print(a/b)              # To divide the numbers
print(a//b)             # To Find the GIF (greatest integer function)
print(a**b)             # To Find the a^b of numbers
print(a%b)              # To find the remainder of numbers (detailed explanation, in punctuators)

## Similar way all the operators works wheather Relational operators or as Assignment operators.
