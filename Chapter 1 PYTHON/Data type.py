#Things to be remember :-
# If we write numeral value in double quotes then it's datatype is not int, it's string.
# For functioning of true function, you have write True ( 'T' must be capital ), similar with python saved keyterms.
# No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.

# Keynote:- Python is an implicit language as it internally defines the datatypes on the basis of given info, whereas in other languages like java, we have to define datatype.
    # like 23 is directly an integer datatype in python whereas, in jave we have to write int(23) then only it's run the command
